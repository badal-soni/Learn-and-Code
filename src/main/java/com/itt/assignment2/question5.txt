class Employee {
    int id;
    string name;
    string department;
    bool working;

public:
    void saveEmployeeToDatabase();
    void printEmployeeDetailReportXML();
    void printEmployeeDetailReportCSV();
    void terminateEmployee();
    bool isWorking();
};

The above class is not following the SRP because of the following reasons:

1. It has methods such as saveEmployeeToDatabase() which takes care of the persistence logic. We should create one repository
   class to handle CRUD operations.

2. It also has methods such as printEmployeeDetailReportXML() and printEmployeeDetailReportCSV() which prints the employee details
   in XML and CSV formats. These are unrelated to the Employee's behaviour. We should create one interface with one abstract method
   export() and can create two classes which implements that interface for CSV and XML report formats.
