class Book {

    function getTitle() {
        return "A Great Book";
    }

    function getAuthor() {
        return "John Doe";
    }

    function turnPage() {
        // pointer to next page
    }

    function getCurrentPage() {
        return "current page content";
    }

    function getLocation() {
        // returns the position in the library
        // ie. shelf number & room number
    }

    function save() {
        $filename = '/documents/'. $this->getTitle(). ' - ' . $this->getAuthor();
        file_put_contents($filename, serialize($this));
    }
}

The above Book class is not obeying the SRP principle because of the following reasons:

1. It has getLocation() method which returns the physical location of the book in Library.
   Instead of this we can create a new class LibraryManager to take care of that logic.

2. It also has a save() method which is handling the persistence logic. Instead of this
   we can create a new class BookRepository class to take care of the CRUD on the book.

3. Also, if in future there is a requirement to change the save functionality then we have
   to change the save method which violates the OCP.
